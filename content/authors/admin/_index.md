Hello! My name is Dylan and I am currently a Masters Student at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. 

My research interests encompass political online behavior of general citizens as well as political elites. How do these individuals behave on social media platforms and how do they present themselves? What kind of information and content polarizes people? To understand these questions I study web-tracking data of citizens and everything political elites put online.

My masters thesis is about how citizens perceive their own news media consumption online in comparison to the actual bias they encounter.
